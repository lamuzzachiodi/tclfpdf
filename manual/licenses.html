<h1>License of TCLFPDF</h1>
<h3> Long anwser ... </h3>

<p><i>TCLFPDF</i> is a port and, as such, is considered a derivative work, so its license is determined by the license of the original work from which it is derived.<p>
<p><i>TCLFPDF </i>was originally a port of FPDF, a PHP library (by Olivier Plathey) that generates PDFs without any external dependencies.<p>
<p>However, tFPDF (by Ian Back and Tycho Veltmeijer) was later used as the reference source. This is a class derived from FPDF and includes UTF8 support, which FPDF lacks.<p>
<p>Speaking more specifically about licenses, we should mention that although, as stated on the FPDF home page: <cite>"F from FPDF stands for Free: you may use it for any kind of usage and modify it to suit your needs"</cite>, to be precise, the FPDF license is not explicitly stated on its website or in its code, so according to the "license.txt" file distributed with the code, it could be interpreted as<i> MIT </i>or similar <b>(see Appendix [1])</b>.
<p>On the other hand, tFPDF is distributed under the <i> LGPL</i> license.<b>(see Appendix [2] )</b></p>
<p>Summarizing FPDF (MIT) -> tFPDF (LGPL) and so...</p>
<h3> Short anwser ... </h3>
<p><b><i>TCLFPDF</i> is licensed under the <u>GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</u></b>.</p>
